                    <b> 15. Why do I need a vaccination certificate?</b><br> A COVID Vaccine Certificate (CVC) issued by the government offers an assurance to the beneficiary on the vaccination, type of vaccine used, and the provisional certificate also
                    provides the next vaccination due. It also is an evidence for the beneficiary to prove to any entities which may require proof of vaccination specially in case of travel. Vaccination not only protects individuals from disease, but
                    also reduces their risk of spreading the virus. Therefore, there could be a requirement in future to produce certificate for certain kind of social interactions and international travel. In this context the certificate issued by Co-WIN
                    has built in security features to guarantee genuineness of the certificate which can be digitally verified using approved utilities which are provided in Co-WIN portal.
